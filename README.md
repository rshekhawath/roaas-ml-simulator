# 🛬 ROAAS ML Simulator

Simulated AI/ML pipeline to predict aircraft landing distance and prevent runway overruns, inspired by the Runway Overrun Awareness and Alerting System (ROAAS) from the aviation safety domain.

---

## ✈️ Objective

The goal is to demonstrate how AI/ML can be applied to aviation safety by predicting landing distances based on aircraft parameters, weather, and runway data—simulating the real-world ROAAS system.
